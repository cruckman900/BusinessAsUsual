📜 LICENSE.md — Proprietary, Expressive, and Airtight
This file lays down the legal foundation for Business As Usual. It’s a custom license designed to:
- Protect your codebase, branding, and onboarding materials from unauthorized use or repackaging.
- Clarify what collaborators, clients, and reviewers can and can’t do with your work.
- Empower you to scale, commercialize, and defend your platform with confidence.

🔐 Coverage Includes:
- Frontend & Backend Code: React, Next.js, ASP.NET Core, FastAPI, and any modular architecture you’ve built.
- Branding Assets: Logos, splash screens, OG images, favicons, animated badges.
- Documentation: Markdown files, onboarding guides, changelogs, and expressive notes.
- Metadata: Manifest files, Twitter cards, preview tags—anything that shapes perception.

🧠 Tone & Structure:
- Written in plain English with legal precision.
- Sections include: Definitions, Grant of License, Restrictions, Attribution, Termination, and Enforcement.
- Optional poetic headers to match your vibe (e.g., “No False Encores” for the termination clause).
