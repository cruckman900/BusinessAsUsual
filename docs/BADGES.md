🏷️ BADGES.md — Project Identity in SVG Form
This file documents the anatomy, styling, and strategy behind your project badges. These aren’t just decorative—they’re discoverability tools, onboarding signals, and visual hooks.

🧠 Purpose
- Identity: Show off project status, tech stack, or creative milestones
- Discoverability: Help users spot your repo’s vibe at a glance
- Onboarding: Signal readiness, stability, or active development

🖼️ Badge Anatomy
- Format: SVG or PNG, optionally animated
- Variants:
- Static: “Built with ASP.NET Core”, “Dockerized”, “Dark Mode Ready”
- Animated: Pulse, fade, scroll-triggered transitions
- Placement: Top of README.md, optionally embedded in splash screen or footer

🎨 Styling
- Palette: Match site theme (light/dark variants)
- Font: All-caps, bold, legible at small sizes
- Iconography: Geometric marks, tech logos, or expressive symbols

🛠️ Implementation
- Hosting: Local in /public/badges/ or via shields.io for dynamic badges
- Embedding:
![Dockerized](./public/badges/dockerized.svg)
