# Business As Usual — Strategy & Architecture

This document outlines the architectural vision, workflow strategy, and onboarding clarity for contributors to Business As Usual.

---

## 🎯 Project Intentions

- Build a clean, scalable ASP.NET Core MVC application
- Architect with Clean Architecture principles
- Modularize components for future microservices
- Containerize with Docker for consistent dev environments
- Deploy to AWS using ECS, ECR, RDS, and CodePipeline
- Maintain expressive documentation and creative branding

## 🧠 Architectural Philosophy

### Clean Architecture Layers

- **Domain**: Core business logic, entities, value objects
- **Application**: Use cases, service contracts, interfaces
- **Infrastructure**: EF Core, external APIs, file systems
- **UI**: MVC frontend, Razor Pages, controllers

### Microservices (Planned)

- Auth
- Billing
- Products
- Notifications

Each service will be independently deployable, containerized, and optionally split into its own repo.

## 🐳 Docker Strategy

- Linux-based containers via Docker Desktop
- Dockerfile scaffolded from project creation
- Future: docker-compose for multi-service orchestration

## ☁️ AWS Deployment Strategy

| Service           | Purpose                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **ECR**           | Store Docker images                  |
| **ECS (Fargate)** | Deploy containers serverlessly       |
| **RDS**           | Host PostgreSQL or SQL Server        |
| **S3**            | Static assets, backups, logs         |
| **CodePipeline**  | CI/CD orchestration                  |
| **IAM**           | Secure access control                |

---

## 🧪 CI/CD Pipeline

- GitHub Actions for build, test, and Docker push
- AWS CodePipeline for deployment orchestration
- Linting via `.editorconfig` and `dotnet format`
- Future: test coverage reports and badge integration

---

## 🧾 Onboarding Checklist

- ✅ Clone the repo
- ✅ Install Docker Desktop
- ✅ Run the app via Docker or Visual Studio
- ✅ Read `STRATEGY.md` for architecture and workflow
- ✅ Check `NOTES.md` for creative milestones
- ✅ Ask questions, suggest riffs, and contribute with confidence
