🎨 BRANDING.md — Anatomy of a Visual Identity
This file documents the visual soul of Business As Usual. It’s not just logos and favicons—it’s how your platform shows up, feels, and earns trust at first glance.

🔷 Logo Anatomy
- Style: Geometric, modular, all-caps text on white background for versatility.
- Variants: Horizontal, stacked, and icon-only formats.
- Usage: Light and dark mode compatibility, scalable for splash screens, badges, and social previews.

🖼️ OG Image Strategy
- Purpose: Control how your site appears when shared—LinkedIn, Twitter, Discord, etc.
- Design: No human figures. Focused on stepped bars, semi-circles, directional arrows, and bold typography.
- File: /public/og.png or /public/og-image.png, wired via next-seo.config.js or <meta> tags.

🌒 Dark Mode Riffs
- Palette: High contrast, expressive accents, no muddy grays.
- Logo Treatment: Inverted or outlined variants to preserve clarity.
- Splash Sync: Splash screen and Now Playing ticker adapt to theme.

🧩 Favicon Variants
- Sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 180x180 (Apple touch icon).
- Design: Icon-only geometric mark, no text.
- Manifest: Wired via manifest.json and <link rel="icon"> tags.
